### Questions
1. My imaginary client is future me. The request was a website for their equestrian center that laid out the info, purpose, and services. They wanted a mellow theme with clear pictures, if used. The main goal was to create a website with easy navigation and clear information. Left most of the detailing up to me once the important info was set in stone.

2.  Block is making the item display as its own block. Inline is to stay within the other structure like keeping a photo inline with text. Inline block is where you combine the two and have a block level element working inline.

3. This was alot of work.. I think that most of it was intentional, but once again the css is eluding my full grasp. I am getting concepts down and using the textbook helps the most. I can't figure out how to align photos to center.
