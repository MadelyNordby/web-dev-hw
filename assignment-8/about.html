      <h1>The Reasoning Behind this Website</h1>
      <hr></hr>
      <p>
        I chose to display the fundamentals behind making a sound on the French Horn because being able to explain it helps me perform better.<br> As a Music Major I am French Horn primary; meaning I practice, teach, and perform Horn daily. It means alot to me to be able to share what brings me joy and excitement. <br> Playing Horn is a huge part of my daily life and I <em>LOVE</em> it. I find that explaining to other how it works helps my performance as I become more accutely aware of my shortcomings or strengths. <br> There are a great many reasources out there to continue to learn to play French Horn! However, as a beginner I recommend finding a local horn player through the University of Montana or surrounding schools that can help guide you in forming good habits. While YouTube is helpful, it can't troubleshoot the frustrations you are facing like a live Horn player can!
