### Questions
1. HTML has been an interesting struggle for me. All of it was new information and provided a fair amount of struggle for me. I think that images were one of the hardest things for me to get figured out. A lot of the errors that I have made in my progress have been result of my dyslexia flip flopping letters in the code and instead of img src I would have img scr or tabel vs table. I have enjoyed learning all of it. I still don't understand how to get my paragraphs to look the way I want them to but I am getting closer!  
2. I am SOOOO excited for CSS, and absolutely terrified. I am excited to be able to do more personalizations and get the pages to look exactly how I imagine them. I am, however, worried that I am going to struggle in the same ways with CSS as HTML. Fingers crossed for the best!
3. This assignment was fun, and not as hard as I was expecting. Many things are starting to become natural in building these pages but there is always something that throws a wrench in it. For me, I am struggling with how my paragraphs look. I want them to look more aligned to the left while still being center page, if that makes sense. I don't like the centered centered look but I don't like them hugging the edge of left screen either. I want a happy medium and still haven't found out how to fix it!
