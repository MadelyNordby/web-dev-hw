    <div id="Form Embouchure">
      <h2>Forming the Embouchure</h2>
      <p>
        The first step to making a solid sound on the French Horn is to form the proper embouchure. The embouchure is the proper formation of the musculature in your face. </p><p> The purpose of the embouchure is to allow air to pass between your lips causing them to vibrate, or buzz, which then will vibrate through the instrument creating sound. </p><p> The 'proper' embouchure looks different person to person but you can follow a few simple steps to get set up. </p><p> The image below shows an example of what your embouchure can look like, while there are deviations this is the basic idea.</p><p>
        <li>Firstly, say the the letter <em>M</em> and feel the sides of your mouth flex.</li>
        <li>Then, while holding the letter <em>M</em> then say the word <em>POO</em>.</li>
        <li>Finally, try to create a buzzing sound while holding your embouchure still. This is called Free Buzzing.</li>

    <div id="Mouthpiece Buzzing">
      <h2>Buzzing on the Mouthpiece</h2>
      <p>Buzzing on the mouthpiece is the next, and very important step in creating a sound on the Horn. </p><p> Taking all that we covered in 'forming the embouchure', we hold that embouchure and place the mouthpiece onto our embouchure using a 60/40 system. Wanting 60% upper lip and 40% lower lip in the mouthpiece. </p><p> With that all happening, you then push air through your embouchure into the mouthpiece creating a full buzz sound. If you sound like a hoard of angry bees you're doing it right! This is essential to quality sound on the actual instrument! DO NOT attempt your first notes until you can consistently buzz.</p><p> The photo below shows a mouthpiece placed correctly while buzzing. </p>

    <div id="First Notes">
      <h2>Creating that First Sound</h2>
      <p>Putting the whole instrument to your face requires more prep work than one will initially think, but you've made it here! The key to having successsful first notes is to have completed the previous steps to the best of your ability! </p><p> Even professional players will complete those steps everytime they play! An example practice session is seen the in table below. </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>Free Buzzing</td>
          <td>5-10 minutes</td>

      <p> With that in mind its time to make your first sound on the instrument! Keeping that embouchure formed and placing the mouthpiece with the 60/40 system, place the instrument and mouthpiece to your face and buzz that quality buzz you practiced. Hold the note as long as you can and repeat, these are called Longtones.</p> <p>Below is an example of how the Horn will look on your face as you play.</p>
