### Questions
1. Divs = the division of a webpage giving sections and clarity. Ids = this is the unique name for each div of the page identifying it. Class = the similarities or groups with the divs. Spans = the inline equivalent of a div.

2. Alt text is the description that can be read by the computer for those visual impaired. Instead of seeing a picture of a puppy they would hear, photo of a puppy running in the field.

3. This was the best module! I had an actual result at the end that looked neat. I have decided that I much prefer just using youtube videos rather than the whole hassle of uploading it to the website itself. I think in the future I'll upload to youtube and then share and embed. I had alot of fun with this module!
