      <p>This spunky little filly is a fiesty and fantastic little gal. She is learning how to be a top notch trail horse as well as a pretty competent cow horse. She's only a baby at a whole 4 years old, but has had some grand adventures and we are looking forward to many more!
      <br></br>
      As she grows this summer and learns more about what's expected of her progress will bring some large accomplishments. These accomplishments will include riding over 50 miles, alpine lake rides, and hopefully some serious cow sorting.</p>
