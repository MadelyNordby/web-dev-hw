### Questions

1.  The different selector types are universal, element, class, and id. Universal is what it sounds like, using this you can style every element using the * to indicate it. The element selector is for all elements of a certain type, for example if you style h1 then every coded h1 will be the same style. The class selector is for styling the class, similar to element but instead it would be .images and all image classes would be the same. Lastly id selector is like the previous but using the unique id, example being #goat-pic.

The advantages to each depend on your purpose, if I have a multi page website and want uniformity I would use Universal and create a baseline style for the whole site. Whereas if I have one special section I want totally isolated I would use the id and stylize it. The other two seem more personal preference to me.

2. My three colors are Rose Pink, Golden Yellow, and Navy Blue. Rose Pink has a hex code of ff66cc and rgb of 255, 102, 204. Golden Yellow has a hex code of ffdf00 and rgb of 255, 223, 0. Lastly, Navy Blue has a hex code of 000080 and rgb of 0, 0, 128.

3. This has been horribly hard. I can't seem to grasp what I'm doing and the struggle is real. Using the walkthrough was helpful for a little bit, the textbook was more helpful but it was basically all trial and error before I got something that I just submitted. HTML makes sense, this doesn't make any sense.
