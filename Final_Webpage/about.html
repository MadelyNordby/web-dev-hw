      <h2>Go Outside!</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="text">
      <p>Lets gooooo! Outside is the best place to be, and I want to be able to promote a lifestyle outdoors exploring and having fun. I know that for me my favorite memories are made outdoors with friends, family, horses, dogs, or alone! (Take a look at the Gallery for my personal photos of some of my favorite adventures.) </p>
      <p>Remember, going outside doesn't demand anything of you! Just going outside and spending time in the sun has its joys. While I love riding horses, hiking, and fishing; you may have more fun sitting at the park in the shade enjoying the birds. It doesn't matter how you do it, just do it! Go outside and find that world that can bring peace and happiness to your day. </p>
