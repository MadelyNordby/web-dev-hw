# Final Website

### Questions

1. Everything that I learned this semester about web development was totally new! I had never messed with any of it before and a lot of it was really interesting. I want to continue to mess with it and see what new creations I can figure out.

2. Everything that I learned this semester about web design was totally new! Design was really hard for me personally, I could figure out what I wanted but now how to make it look that way. I hope to continue to experiment and see what else I can learn.

3. I just let things happen. I went back to previous assignments and copy and pasted things I liked, and edited it to fit my new website. I really just tried to have fun and express myself. Honestly, the hardest part was figuring what to make it about.
