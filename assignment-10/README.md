# Assignment 10

### Questions
1. System fonts - These are the fonts on my computer that are already installed, not necessarily available on the web.
Web fonts - These are fonts hosted on a server, like the google fonts that I used on my assignment.
Web-safe fonts - These are fonts that all computers can load and view the same, like Arial.

2. Fall back fonts are super important! Having a primary font is all good, but if it doesn't load you need that font stack to give you the fall back font. The guy to save the day if your previous fancy idea wasn't loading. Always good to have a plan b. 

3. This assignment actually made sense, I let it be a little simpler than my approach to the first color assignment. I still struggle with the color but at least I felt a little more comfortable using css as well as the html.
