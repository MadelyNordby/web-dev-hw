### Question responses
1. From what I understand you can only have one head and one body element. They are the outline or the cage that keeps everything organized. Obviously websites have multiple pages so there is where we find the multiple head or body elements but on a single page there is only one. The head element contains more materials that the user won't see displayed. The body contains the meat of the site where the user finds what they are searching for.

2. Structural Markup embeds information about the structure of a document, this includes the elements of headings, paragraphs, and lists.
Semantic Markup is used to reinforce the meaning of the information in the document, like bold, italics, or quotations.

3. This assignment was really straightforward for me once I got ahold of what the heck I was doing with images. There is a lot to remember which gets a little overwhelming. However I just started at the top of my website and just followed the assignment steps to keep myself on track. I think that it has to potential to be really fun once I get more of a grip on the many different elements and links!
